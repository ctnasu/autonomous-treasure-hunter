In the project, the Dijkstra algorithm is used for the treasure hunter to find the shortest path on the map. The Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the shortest path in weighted graph problems. Each node on the map represents a point, and the edges represent the connections between these points. Using this algorithm, the treasure hunter is guided to reach the targets by traversing the map. Within the scope of the project, ready-made data structures were not used, and nodes and edges on the map were managed appropriately using data structure knowledge. Thus, the necessary information for the treasure hunter's movement was effectively stored and processed. This project is written in C#. It is designed using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. The game is coded in accordance with the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each element (treasure, obstacle, character) is modeled as an object, and the relationships between these objects are ensured through the principles of inheritance and polymorphism. This design increases the modularity of the code and ensures reusability.
